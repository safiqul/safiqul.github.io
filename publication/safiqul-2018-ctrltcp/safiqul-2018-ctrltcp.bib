 abstract = {We present ctrlTCP, a method to combine the congestion controls of multiple TCP connections. In contrast to the previous methods such as the Congestion Manager, ctrlTCP can couple all TCP flows that leave one sender, traverse a common bottleneck (e.g., a home user's thin uplink) and arrive at different destinations. Using ns-2 simulations and an implementation in the FreeBSD kernel, we show that our mechanism reduces queuing delay, packet loss, and short flow completion times while enabling precise allocation of the share of the available bandwidth between the connections according to the needs of the applications.},
