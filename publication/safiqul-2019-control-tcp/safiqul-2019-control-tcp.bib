 abstract = {In multi-tenant datacenters, the hardware may be homogeneous but the
traffic often is not. For instance, customers who pay an equal amount of
money can get an unequal share of the bottleneck capacity when they do not
open the same number of TCP connections. To address this problem, several
recent proposals try to manipulate the traffic that TCP sends from the VMs.
VCC and AC/DC are two new mechanisms that let the hypervisor control
traffic by influencing the TCP receiver window (rwnd). This avoids changing
the guest OS, but has limitations (it is not possible to make TCP increase
its rate faster than it normally would). Seawall, on the other hand,
completely rewrites TCP's congestion control, achieving fairness but
requiring significant changes to both the hypervisor and the guest OS.
There seems to be a need for a middle ground: a method to control TCP's
sending rate without requiring a complete redesign of its congestion
control. We introduce a minimally-invasive solution that is flexible enough
to cater for needs ranging from weighted fairness in multi-tenant
datacenters to potentially offering Internet-wide benefits from reduced
inter-flow competition.},
