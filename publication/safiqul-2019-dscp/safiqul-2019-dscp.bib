 abstract = {The DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) field in the IP header allows to specify a
desired per-hop behavior as packets traverse routers. Setting the DSCP
field opportunistically, without prior contractual agreement, has recently
become accepted practice for Internet end hosts. Measurement studies find
that there is reason to hope for a DSCP setting to have an effect on
traffic, and at least configuring this value is not heavily detrimental:
systematic drops of packets due to non-zero DSCP values are rare, and the
value is often left intact along an end-to-end path. What these studies do
not discuss is whether per-hop behaviors truly are honored: what happens to
packets in terms of the delay they experience? In this paper, we make an
attempt to find a first answer to this by mining a dataset of our own
recent large-scale measurement study. Using a deep neural network, we
obtain the importance of the factors which help us understand the delay
impact of the DSCP.},
