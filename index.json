Multipath transport protocols, like MPTCP, are being deployed (e.g., in smartphones), allowing transparent simultaneous use of multiple links. Besides providing increased resilience to link failures, multipath transports may better exploit available (aggregate) capacity across all interfaces. The safest way to ensure fairness is to assume that any subflows of a multipath end-to-end connection may share bottleneck links, but knowledge of non-shared bottlenecks could allow multipath senders to exploit more capacity without being unfair to other flows. The problem of reliably detecting the existence of (non)-shared bottlenecks is not trivial and is compounded by the fact that bottlenecks may change due to traffic dynamics. In this paper we focus on practical methods to reliably group flows that share, possibly dynamic, bottlenecks online and in a passive manner (i.e., without injecting measurement traffic). We introduce a novel dynamic clustering algorithm that we apply to update our previous shared bottleneck flow grouping (SBFG) method standardized by the IETF, based on delay statistics. We also adapt an offline SBFG method based on wavelet filters to enable it for online operation. These SBFG methods are evaluated by a simple testbed, rigorous simulation and real-world Internet experiments in a testbed comprised of multihomed hosts. Our results suggest that there is no clear winner, and selection of the “best” SBFG method will have to consider tradeoffs regarding accuracy, lag, and application requirements.","tags":[""],"title":"Online Identification of Groups of Flows Sharing a Network Bottleneck","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Either copy related “QUEUE/PIE” related settings to your ns-default file or replace your ns-default.tcl file with the attached [ns-default.tcl] (/ns2/ns-default.tcl).

However, nowadays, applications are beginning to directly set the DSCP themselves, in the hope that this will yield a more appropriate service for their respective video, audio and data streams. WebRTC is a prime example of such an application. We present measurements, for both IPv4 and IPv6, of what happens to DSCP values along Internet paths after an end system has set them without any prior agreement between a customer and a service provider. We find that the DSCP is often changed or zeroed along the path, but detrimental effects from using the DSCP are extremely rare; moreover, DSCP values sometimes remain intact (potentially having an effect on traffic) for several AS hops. This positive result motivates an analysis of the potential latency impact from such DSCP usage, for which we present the first measurement results. We find that routers at approximately 3% of more than 100,000 links differentiate between the WebRTC DSCP values (EF, AF42 and CS1) and consistently reduce delay in comparison with probes carrying a zero value (CS0) under congestion. In contrast, routers at around 2% of these links increase the delay by a comparable amount under congestion, uniformly for EF, AF42 and CS1.","tags":null,"title":"On the utility of unregulated IP DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) usage by end systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1524693600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524693600,"objectID":"25a649ae17fed08be857048476a2e5a3","permalink":"https://safiqul.github.io/talk/noms-2018/","publishdate":"2018-04-26T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/noms-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Lightweight and Flexible Single-Path Congestion Control Coupling","type":"talk"},{"authors":["S.

Real-life experiments and simulations show that our solution works for a wide variety of congestion control mechanisms, provides great flexibility when allocating application traffic to the connections, and results in lower queuing delay and less packet loss.","tags":[],"title":"Lightweight and Flexible Single-Path Congestion Control Coupling","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1499032800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499032800,"objectID":"5027e859079ce02a07cd284d57021de1","permalink":"https://safiqul.github.io/talk/phd-trial-lecture/","publishdate":"2017-07-03T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd-trial-lecture/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Distributed Ledgers and their application to Internet Protocols","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1499032800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499032800,"objectID":"83b7e9f8a09ffcaedda6d3373233322a","permalink":"https://safiqul.github.io/talk/phd-def/","publishdate":"2017-07-03T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd-def/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Lightweight and Flexible Single-Path Congestion Control Coupling","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1487286000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1487286000,"objectID":"7ba6bc32a2a2e5f76362927a748d775f","permalink":"https://safiqul.github.io/talk/ietf99-tcpm/","publishdate":"2017-02-17T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ietf99-tcpm/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"TCB Control Block Sharing: 2140bis","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Safiqul Islam","Michael Welzl","Kristian Hiorth","David Hayes","Oystein Dale","Greville Ar- mitage","Stein Gjessing"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485903600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485903600,"objectID":"8a58d2b86f1fea370e3f6d36be93c5d1","permalink":"https://safiqul.github.io/publication/tech-report-2/","publishdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tech-report-2/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Single-Path TCP Congestion Control Coupling","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1479164400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479164400,"objectID":"87ed5a37626e59de4205fa165c90c54e","permalink":"https://safiqul.github.io/talk/ietf97-iccrg/","publishdate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ietf97-iccrg/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"TCP-CCC: single-path TCP congestion control coupling ","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1475532000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475532000,"objectID":"a4efefd5cb86fefca5ac0014d7fcb392","permalink":"https://safiqul.github.io/talk/imcec-2016/","publishdate":"2016-10-04T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/imcec-2016/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"OpenTCP: Combining Congestion Controls of Parallel TCP Connections","type":"talk"},{"authors":["S.

For both the operator and content providers, streaming of media generates most of its revenue through advertisements inserted in the content. One common approach is to pre-stitched (i.e. insert) advertisements into the content. Another approach is dynamic advertisement insertion, which inserts advertisements at run-time while the media is being streamed. Dynamic advertisement insertion gives operators the flexibility to insert advertisements based on context, such as the user's geographic location or the user's preferences. Developing a technique to successfully insert advertisements dynamically into the streaming media has several challenges, such as maintaining synchronization of the media, choosing the appropriate transport format for media delivery, and finding a splicing boundary that starts with a key frame. The details of these challenges are detailed in this thesis. We carried out extensive research to find the best transport format for delivery of media and we studied prior work in an effort to find an appropriate streaming solution to perform dynamic advertisement insertion. Based upon this research and our study of prior work we identify the best transport format for delivery of media chunks, then propose, implement, and evaluate a technique for advertisement insertion.","tags":["HTTP Stream","MPEG-2 TS","MP4","Advertisements","Media Plane Management"],"title":"A HTTP Streaming Video Server with Dynamic Advertisement Splicing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sumanta Saha","Safiqul Islam","Sakhawat Hossen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1216677600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1216677600,"objectID":"d07d17fef7bfdf7b933dcda75b085571","permalink":"https://safiqul.github.io/publication/ids-2008/","publishdate":"2008-07-22T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ids-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Novel Overlay IDS for Wireless Sensor Networks","type":"publication"}]
